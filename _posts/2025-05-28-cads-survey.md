CADSbib is a bibliography containing corpus-based studies on discourse analysis. The initial version was collected between 2021-2025 and contains over 500 entries.

This bibliography is the basis for the survey on the development of CADS that was conducted as part of my PhD work. Stay tuned for its publication to read my account of how the field has developed over the last three decades!
