I’m a corpus linguist with an interdisciplinary background spanning German and English linguistics, computational linguistics, and Scandinavian Studies. My research interests include discourse analysis, digital humanities, and linguistic annotation, with a particular focus on methodology.
I’m especially interested in questions like:
- How do linguistic patterns emerge across discourses and genres?
- How can we make corpus research more reproducible, interpretable and transparent while maintaining the crucial role of subjective interpretation?
- What can corpus methods offer in comparion to, and in conjunction with, machine learning?

Currently based in a digital humanities group, I'm a research associate on the <a href='https://www.dhss.phil.fau.eu/research/current-projects/reading-concordances-in-the-21st-century-rc21/'>Reading concordances in the 21st century (RC21)</a> project, where we're developing a flexible and transparent approach to concordance analysis.
